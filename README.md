# OpenSource Optical Vulnerability (OSOV) ImageJ Scripts

## Installation

[Download the latest version](https://github.com/OpenSourceOV/imagej-scripts/archive/master.zip) and unzip.

In the ImageJ directory...

* Put the OSOV folder in the plugins directory (e.g. c:\ImageJ\plugins\OSOV)
* Put the OSOV Toolbox.ijm in the macros/toolsets folder (e.g. c:\ImageJ\macros\toolsets\OSOV Toolbox.ijm)
* Restart ImageJ

On Mac systems the easiest way to get to the ImageJ application folder is to go to Applications in Finder (usually accessible from the Favorites list on the left panel) and right-click the Image J app (e.g. 'Fiji.app') and click 'Show Package Contents'.

Once installed you can access the macros and plugins from the toolsets menu or the normal plugin menu (under 'OSOV'). To add the toolset to the toolbar use the More Tools icon (>>) at the far right of the toolbar (See the [ImageJ User Guide - Custom Tools](https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/docs/guide/146-20.html) for more information) and select 'OSOV Toolbox'.
